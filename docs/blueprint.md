# **App Name**: SmartSeller

## Core Features:

- Role-Based Access Control: Implement admin and employee roles with different access permissions based on user credentials stored in Firestore. When the application starts for the first time and no user data is found in the Firestore collection, display a modal form prompting the user to create an admin account (name, username, password). Store user data (roles, username, password) in a 'users' collection in Firestore, but DO NOT use Firebase Authentication. Only two roles are supported: admin and employee.
- Login Page: Design a login page with the store's logo (on the side), name, address, and phone number. Include an indicator to show the database connection status (checking if it's ready to login).
- Product Management: Enable adding, editing, and deleting products with details such as name, category, stock, price, image link (with preview), and description. Display boxes indicating 'most stocked product' and 'least stocked product'. Implement search and filter products based on category. Each product in the product list will have an image and edit/delete actions. Use Firestore to store and retrieve product data, including categories and topings.
- Topping Management: Enable adding, editing, and deleting toppings with details such as name, stock, price, image link (with preview), and description. Display boxes indicating 'most stocked topping' and 'least stocked topping'. Implement search. Each topping in the topping list will have an image, stock level and edit/delete actions. Store topping data in Firestore.
- Category Management: Enable adding, editing, and deleting categories with a form for category name and description. Implement search functionality using a magnifying glass icon/button. Each category in the category list will have edit/delete actions. Store Category data in Firestore.
- Cashier Interface: Design a user-friendly interface for order taking, including product search and filtering by category.  For Tablet view: use a 60:40 two-column layout (Products on the right, Cart on the left). For Mobile view: hide the cart and payment methods initially, and reveal with a sticky shopping cart icon/button. Implement a tabbed interface: Tab 1: Products (Image, Name, Category, Description, Stock), Tab 2: Topping Variants (same display as products). Display all products/toppings in a scrollable list without limiting the number of displayed items. Flow Pemesanan: Klik produk → Modal "Pilih Varian Toping", Modal berisi: List toping (checkbox), keterangan, tombol (Tanpa Toping/Batal/Pesan (tombol pesan muncul ketika diceklis toping dan tombol tanpa toping hilang begitu sebaliknya), keterangan tetap muncul) Setelah pesan → langsung masuk keranjang (nama pesanan, jumlah item, toping, keterangan total harga termasuk toping).
- Payment Processing: Support various payment methods (Cash, QRIS, E-Wallet, Bank Transfer, Ojek Online) with a modal for entering payment details upon selecting a payment method. For Cash payments: Input money received + display change due (with a 'Pas' button if the exact amount is given). Buttons: 'Bayar' and 'Batal'. After clicking 'Bayar' show the final receipt modal with 'Print Struk', 'kirim WA/Email' and 'Selesai' buttons. The print/WA/Email options should be configurable in the admin settings. Log payment events in Firestore.
- Purchase Management: Enable recording purchases with details such as product name, supplier, quantity, price, and description using a modal form ('Tambah Pembelian Barang'). Implement search functionality for purchases by 'hari ini' (today), 'bulan ini' (this month). Display 'total pengeluaran' (total expenses) and 'jumlah transaksi' (number of transactions). Show a list of purchases, including the name of the employee who entered the purchase and a 'View' action (edit/delete actions inside a message box/modal).  Store and retrieve purchase data in Firestore, restricting view access based on user roles. Employees can only see their own purchase entries.
- Reporting and Analytics: Generate sales and profit reports with filtering options for 'hari ini' (today), 'bulan ini' (this month), and a calendar date range (start date - end date). Display key metrics such as 'total Penjualan' (total sales), 'jumlah transaksi' (number of transactions), and 'Jumlah produk yang laku' (number of products sold). Show a list of sales transactions, including the name of the employee who entered the sale and a 'View' action (edit, print receipt, and delete actions in a message box/modal). Restrict report access based on user roles. Employees can only see their own sales entries. Use Firestore data to calculate and present these metrics.
- Profit Reporting: Generate profit reports with filtering options for 'hari ini' (today), 'bulan ini' (this month), and a calendar date range (start date - end date).

## Style Guidelines:

- The color scheme is primarily light, employing shades of white, with strategically placed accents of gold (#FFD700), green (#00FF00), and yellow (#FFFF00) to create an elegant and visually appealing experience. The shades are not particularly vibrant; they are mostly quite desaturated.
- Font: 'PT Sans' for a clear and professional look suitable for all browsers.
- The layout should be responsive and tablet-friendly, automatically scaling to tablet size when viewed on larger screens. The application must support vertical alignment for handheld devices such as phones or smaller tablets.
- Implement subtle and engaging animations for modals and other UI elements to enhance the user experience.
- Use aesthetically pleasing icons that are easily recognizable across different browsers and devices.
